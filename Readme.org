* How do I stream directly to media player?
you will first need to tell youtube-dl to stream media to stdout with -o -, and
also tell your media player to readfrom stdin (it must be capable of this for
streaming) and the pipe former to latter. For example, streaming to vlc can be
achieved with 

youtube-dl -o - "https..." | vlc -
* Man page
     -o,                                                 --output
     TEMPLATENUMBERFILEFILEDIRENCODINGUAURLFIELD:VALUE:\[aq].
          You can use this option multiple times
* testing
  #+begin_src python
    import youtube_dl

    ydl_opts = {'outtmpl':'-'}                                                                             
    ydl = youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts)                                                                   
  #+end_src
